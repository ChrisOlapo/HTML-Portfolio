<h1>ChrisOlapo's Netflix List </h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Netflix Row</h2>
<hr />
<h3>1. How To Get Rich</h3>

It is Netflix Doc on understanding money.  It talks about the pitfalls of money, how to understand money and also to make sure that money does not rule me.</p>

<h3>2. The Playlist</h3>

    It is Netflix Doc on understanding Spotify.  This is interesting as I enjoy using Spotify and understanding how a music website was able to change how people consume music.
<h3>3. Alice In Borderlands</h3>

    It is a Netflix series continuing with the second season. I enjoyed the first seadon and I am looking to see the continuation and see if the protagonists escape the island and get back to the real world.
